## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#00008B) to convey professionalism and modernity, with a space theme.
- Background color: Dark blue (#00008B) for a space theme.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) or white (#FFFFFF) for CTAs and text, providing contrast against the dark background.
- Body text: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font for a modern, neutral, and readable appearance in light blue or white. Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font that will pair well with the Inter body font, also in light blue or white.
- The header area, resume download and hero sections, as well as the footer area should use a max-width container to center the content on larger screens.
- Implement subtle fade-in and slide-in animations triggered on scroll to enhance user experience without overwhelming.
- Utilize a set of consistent icons (feather or outline style) for skills and contact information.
